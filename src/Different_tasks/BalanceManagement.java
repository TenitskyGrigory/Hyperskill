/**
 * Your task is to implement the method changeBalance to control balances. It has the following declaration:
 *
 * public static boolean changeBalance(Account account, Operation operation, Long sum)
 * If the given operation is DEPOSIT the method adds the sum to the account's balance.
 * If the operation is WITHDRAW the method subtracts the given sum from the account's balance.
 * If the given sum is greater than the balance, the method shouldn't change it. Instead,
 * the method must output the string "Not enough money to withdraw." (without quotes, don't forget the full point).
 * In any case, the method returns a boolean value â€” true if the balance has changed, false if it hasn't.
 * Example 1
 *
 * The following values are passed to the method: operation = Operation.DEPOSIT,
 * sum = 2000. The initial balance of the account is 1000.
 *
 * In this case, the method returns "true" and the new account balance is 3000.
 *
 * Example 2
 *
 * The following values are passed to the method: operation = Operation.WITHDRAW,
 * sum = 5000. The initial balance of the account is 2000.
 *
 * In this case, the method returns "false", the account's balance is not changed (2000)
 * and method prints "Not enough money to withdraw.".
